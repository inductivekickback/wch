[Wall Control pegboards](https://www.wallcontrol.com/) look nice but bending the tabs on the hangers to secure them is annoying. Although the metal hangers are useful for hanging heavy items and shelves, 3D-printed hangers can be customized and are easier to install and remove.<br><br><br><br>

### Clone
Replicating the original hanger shape for 3D printing doesn't work very well. Stability is decent when something is pulling the hanger straight down but the hanger feels very fiddly otherwise. Adding tabs to the hanger would make it much harder to print while providing little improvement in stability.<br><br><br>

### Improved
Here is an improved hanger that simplifies the base while adding a few features:

 - Post at the top of the hanger opposes the top of the slot to provide vertical support
 - Reusable clip with a retaining notch locks the hanger in place but is easy to remove
 - Flat outside edge makes it easy to fuse custom extensions

### Xmas light hangers
Xmas light holders provide an example of how hangers can be customized.

The horizontal hanger is relatively simple and consists of a single piece (plus the clip):

The holder is printed as a separate component and then snapped into a hole in the base:

 - The holder is printed horizontally for simplicity and strength
 - The holder can be assembled in two different orientations for use on the left or right side of the board
 - The holder snaps in securely

This is the fully-assembled vertical hanger:
